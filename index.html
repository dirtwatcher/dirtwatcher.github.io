        <p>*Fire Emblem: Awakening* for the 3DS, colloquially known as FE13, was the first *Fire Emblem* game I ever played, and was single-handedly responsible for my becoming a fan of Strategy-RPGs.  I had to have more of that sort of tactical gameplay after finishing it for the first time and this included checking out some of the other *Fire Emblem* games.  After so many years, playing the newer games as they came out, trying out many different kinds of SRPGs, recently finishing *Shadow Dragon* and *New Mystery of the Emblem*, I decided to try *Awakening* again, curious as to what I'd think of it.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, I still loved it, even though I think I've played tighter games, even after having seen the criticisms over the years and agreeing with some of them, and the only thing I can think of is that I find it fun.  It's enjoyable, and it's not just the gameplay that factors in here, but the presentation too.</p>
        <p>The mainline games after <em>Awakening</em> are</p>
        <ol start="14">
            <li>Fire Emblem: Fates</li>
            <li>Fire Emblem: Echoes</li>
            <li>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</li>
        </ol>
